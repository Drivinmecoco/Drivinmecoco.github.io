            He has come a long way in search of a new home for his children.
            The landslide that had destroyed his pond had been devastating.
            They have been traveling for days, and they were all exhausted.
            But Alexphibian the Great was determined to find a new home for his children,
            a place where they would be safe and happy.

            He is a greedy and ambitious frog.
            He had already amassed 50 ponds to his name, but he was not satisfied.
            He always wanted more. One day, he came across a particularly lovely pond.
            It was surrounded by lush green trees and had crystal clear water.
            Emperor Frogaparte knew that he had to have it.
